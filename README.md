To build a web application called later that’s inspired by popular read-it-later websites such as Instapaper (www.instapaper.com) and Pocket (getpocket.com)

The read-it-later page on the left has stripped away all of the navigation from the target website, preserving the main content and title.

RESTful routes:

POST /articles—Create a new article
GET /articles/:id—Get a single article
GET /articles—Get all articles
DELETE /articles/:id—Delete an article
